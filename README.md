- This game was made using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS with the intent of learning more about game development.
- A majority of this game was made by following this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI9idPTT0c4) by Chris Courses, so I can’t take all the credit
- Updates will take time. I’m not very fast when it comes to coding.
